# Mini-Verilog-Processor

## Description of the Repository:
Minimal 8-bit CPU designed and implemented in Verilog, featuring a custom ISA, register file, ALU, instruction/data memory and testbench simulation. Educational project focused to understand more deeply computer architecture and digital design.

## Directories Description:
  - _src:_
Contains all description of the processor written in Verilog.

  - _tb:_
Contains some testbench to make sure the mini-cpu is working.

  - _tools:_
Contains a Python assembler file to make possible to write programs for the mini 8-bit CPU.
